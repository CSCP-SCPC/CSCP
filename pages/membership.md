Membership is open to all who support the aims of the society.

Dues are $20 per year; $35 for 2 years; $10 per year for students/unwaged/underemployed.

Membership payments can be made at our annual meeting.  At other times of the year, membership inquiries may be directed to the treasurer, Paul Franks (pfranks <at> tyndale.ca).  We are only able to accept payment by cash or cheque (made payable to the Canadian Society of Christian Philosophers).

Please note that all presenters at the annual meeting must be members of the society.
