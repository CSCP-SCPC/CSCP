Membership is open to all who support the aims of the society.

Dues are:
<ul>
	<li>$20 for 1 year</li>
	<li>$35 for 2 years</li>
	<li>$10 per year for students/unwaged/underemployed</li>
	<li>$350 lifetime</li>
</ul>
Please note that all presenters at the annual meeting must be members of the society.

Payment can be made by cheque (made payable to the Canadian Society of Christian Philosophers). Contact the treasurer, Paul Franks (pfranks@tyndale.ca), for the mailing address. Once in-person meetings resume, we can also accept payment via cash at the annual meeting. 

We are now able to accept dues via e-transfer or credit card. To pay via e-transfer, send your payment to CanadianSCP@outlook.com and then email the treasurer the security question and answer. To pay with a credit card, select your membership type below and click "Pay Now." From there you will be directed to PayPal's website where you can either log into your PayPal account or just select "Pay with Credit Card or Visa Debit."
