We invite submissions in any field of philosophy, that, by virtue of its topic, may be of particular interest to Christian philosophers. Please submit an abstract of no more than 500 words (which should be formatted as a Word, pdf, or rtf document). Submissions may be in either French or English. Those who are interested should send their abstract, prepared for blind review, to Prof. Jennifer Hart Weed: jweed@unb.ca.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline: February 1st, 2021.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main event will be a lecture by Professor Graeme Hunter, Research Professor at Dominican University College in Ottawa.  For updates and for information on the society, visit our website: &lt;a href=&quot;www.cscp-scpc.ca&quot;&gt;www.cscp-scpc.ca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
